For Lab 3, I have done data lab 1, these are the changes I made to the file:

Added 1 new SPAM LF, which classifies a comment as SPAM if a link(URL) is detected
Added 1 new Paws LF, which classfies a comment as Paws if words like "love" or "amazing" are detected.
Used new classifiers instead of the Logistic Regression.
