# MLOps Labs

I learned a TON about Python imports, testing frameworks, and managing virtual environments. And I have always struggled with Git for no reason.ðŸ˜…

## How to Run the Lab:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Activate Python virtual environment (`lab_01`).
3. Run:
   - `pytest test/test_pytest.py`
   - `python test/test_unittest.py`

## Personal Notes:
- I had to dig into Python's sys.path and importsâ€”a super valuable debugging experience!
- Custom commit history includes fixes for virtual environment usage.
- Proudly tested everything locally before pushing!
