# MLOps Labs

I learned a TON about Python imports, testing frameworks, and managing virtual environments. And I have always struggled with Git for no reason.ðŸ˜…

## How to Run the Lab:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Activate Python virtual environment (`lab_01`).
3. Run:
   - `pytest test/test_pytest.py`
   - `python test/test_unittest.py`

## What I Learned
- How to fix sys.path import errors by hand.
- Running and organizing local versus cloud code.
- The importance of local tests before submitting!
